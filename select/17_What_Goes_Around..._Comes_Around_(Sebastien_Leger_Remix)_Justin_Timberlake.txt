Hey girl (girl), is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world (world)
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you baby (baby)
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong (uh)

Don't want to think about it (uh)
Don't want to talk about it (uh)
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it (uh)
Feeling the blues about it (yeah)
I just can't do without ya
Now tell me is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down? (Is this how we say goodbye?)
Should've known better when you came around (That you were gonna make me cry)
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around ('Cause I know that you're livin' a lie)
That's okay baby cause in time you will find

What goes around, goes around, goes around comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around comes all the way back around, yeah

Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)
Funny thing about that is I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby (baby)
And now, it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong (uh)

Don't want to think about it (no)
Don't want to talk about it (hm)

(...)

Yup, yup, yup
Let me paint this picture for you, baby
Yup

You spend your nights alone, and he never comes home
And every time you call him all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doing to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?

When you cheated girl, my heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody (hey)
To cure the lonely nights (hey)
You wish you had somebody (hey)
That could come and make it right (hey)
But girl I ain't somebody (hey)
With a lot of sympathy (hey)
You'll see, see

(What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey, hey (What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey, hey (What goes around comes back around)
I thought I told ya, hey, hey (What goes around comes back around)

I thought I told ya, hey, hey (Yup, yup, I think you'd do it, babe)
(Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey-hey, break it to her, hey)
See (hey-hey, hey-hey)
You should listen to me, baby (Hey, break it to her, hey, hey-hey, hey-hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Hey-hey, hey-hey, hey)
Because (What goes around comes back around)
Hmm
