It was cool in the fifties scattin' to
Jazz and be-bop
It was the sound they were throwin' down
From LA to New York and
In every town

And with the rhythm in your souls
Add a hip-hop and bop n'
Just so ya know
This thing it's back swing is king,
Call it New Jack

(Chorus)
What goes around, comes around
(And that's the way it goes)
What goes around comes around and
Comes around
Like that, a riff and a rhythm
What goes around, comes around
(And that's the way it goes)
What goes around, comes around
Like that, like that

Round, round and round
Round we go
Round, round and round
Round we go

People stomped in the cities
Jumpin' to the groove of the music
They rocked and jammed
With the hipster clan
In the clubs, in the streets
And on every beat
And with the be-bop in their souls
They took the swing thing and
Started to roll
And now it's a fact a little hip-hop
And bop has found a way back

(Repeat Chorus)

Be-bop, hip-hop,
Hep hop don't stop
Be-bop, hip-hop,
Add pop don't stop

(Rap)
Bix he had a bag of tricks
Parker came along exactly when
He changed the mix
Sax made a bang,
Monk made a change
And be-bop laid the tracks
For the Coltrane
They were getting busy,
A trumpet pumped
Your head got Dizzy and
You started to bump
They had a style,
Beat was the backbone
You could see for Miles,
Mr. Philly Joe Jones

You may not realize swing
Was here before
Because it's disguised and we've
Added so much more
The time is now to show you how
To get the groove into your shoes

(Repeat Chorus)
Round, round and round
Round we go
Round, round and round
Round we go
(Repeat)
What goes around and round
Must come around and around
(Repeat)
